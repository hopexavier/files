## Abstract:
This work describes a mobile system that has been developed to precisely and reliably carry out echolocation experiments (data collection) for later analysis. A Kobuki robot was used as a base unit, providing mobility and accurate odometry. Custom mounting hardware was designed for the robot to accommodate a laptop for controlling the robot, along with a Microsoft Kinect sensor and ultrasonic transducers for taking experimental measurements. A Python based software package was designed to provide simple control of the robot and its sensors. This software was designed to work within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, and includes high-level interfaces for controlling robot movement and for the simultaneous playing and recording of sounds. Each data-collection experiment consists of a sequence of movements and measurements that the robot should perform. The system we have developed will make future data collection simple, allowing for subsequent study and analysis of echo signals.

# MUSSE: A designed multi-ultrasonic-sensor system for echolocation on multiple robots
### Xiaodong Wu; Miguel Abrahantes; Mark Edgington
## Abstract:
This paper presents a multi-ultrasonic-sensor system designed for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on the open source robot Kobuki Turtlebot. The operating system used in this research project, Robot Operating System (ROS), is also an open source project initially released in 2007. Our system has reduced response time and lower cost than traditional laser sensors. It consists of 8 HY-SRF05 rangers that can work sequentially on an embedded system such as a Raspberry Pi. The communication between the embedded system and the robot is achieved with a Python package that communicates via local TCP/IP. Our multi-sensor structure can be applied to a multi-agent system, composed of 3 identical robots. Our results from preliminary experiments show the possibility of conducting SLAM using our designed system. By implementing this improved design on a multi-agent system, the SLAM process can be conducted more efficiently and accurately than a single robot with a laser sensor.
